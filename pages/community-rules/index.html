      <p>To develop an NFT marketplace for digital creators, collectors and stakeholders in the ecosystem
        must have mutual respect among themselves. We want to set a few key expectations and rules
        for everyone while providing an unprecedented level of cultural openness. By embodying these
        ideals and working with us, we can create a welcoming community that empowers both
        collectors and creators alike and develops ethical screening criteria.
      </p><br>
      <h4>FAITH-INSPIRED NFT ETHICAL SCREENING CRITERIA</h4> <br>

      <p>The following types of NFTs will not be permitted into the Amacrux.<br> <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Promoting any unethical financial practices interest-based lending and borrowing.
        </li>
        <li>Promoting or representing discriminatory, abusive, or hateful acts.
        </li>
        <li>Pornographic content.</li>
      </ol>
      </p> <br>
      <p>
        For anything truly new to be introduced, we must lead by the values of kindness and inclusivity.
        In building a community that is accepting of all; displaying respect and care for one another is
        crucial. Content creators, artists, and brands are at the center of everything we do. As a result,
        they are the ones to determine the authenticity of work uploaded to Amacrux. Verified creators
        will have the equivalent of a Twitter "blue tick". It is vitally important to build trust in a community
        to sustain it over time. Amacrux allows you to mint and sell NFTs in the following ways:
        All of your rights to the original work remain with you, including the copyrights and trademarks.
        Using your piece, you can replicate it, distribute it, exhibit it, and make derivative works. As a
        creator, you are not allowed to:
        <li>Uploading someone else's work that is protected by copyright or otherwise proprietary is not
          allowed.
        </li>
        <li>Using your piece, you can replicate it, distribute it, exhibit it, and make derivative works.
          As a creator, you are not allowed to:
        </li> <br>
        <li>Uploading someone else's work that is protected by copyright or otherwise proprietary is not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>NFTs representing the same piece cannot be created multiple times unless offered as a multitoken
          collection (ERC-1155/ BEP-1155 token standards).
        </li> <br>
        NFT collectors are providing patronage to the arts (and also charities, in the case of Amacrux
        developers), in a way that provides sustainable revenue sources for digital creatives. Collectors
        can't claim rights to ownership, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property relating
        to the NFT token.
