        Amacrux is the first community NFT marketplace that incentivizes creators and collectors to trade user content
        and useful digital assets in the real world. The marketplace will allow creators to mint their digital image,
        audio and video files as NFTs and offer them for sale or auction.

      <h1>
        1. AMACRUX PROTOCOL
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        The protocol is an Ethereum-based NFT marketplace that will allow users to monetize useful content through the
        minting and trading of NFTs. In addition, the platform provides an interface with dynamic tools to apply to
        financial services and online stores using smart contracts powered by the native AMAX token. Multi-chain
        interoperability increases marketplace sustainability, optimizes blockchain energy consumption, and expands
        customer reach for Amacrux.

      <h1>
        1.1 IMPORTANCE OF NFTs
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        NFTs are basically digital assets that cannot be replicated or reproduced. An NFT is a digital asset that exists
        completely in the digital universe—you can't touch it, but you can own it. NFTs are giving more power to content
        creators than ever before. <br>
        An NFT is created or “minted” from various digital assets that represent tangible and intangible objects from
        the real-world.

      </p><br><br>


      <h1>
        1.2 ERC-721 vs ERC-1155
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        NFTs are generally made using ERC-721 smart contracts on Ethereum compatible blockchains. While this type of
        contract gives them the unique properties that make them so unstable (scarcity, verifiable and authenticity), it
        also has some limitations. Each ERC-721 token has a unique identification, for which there can be only one
        token. This makes batch operations very expensive in terms of gas rates and makes coached property impossible.
        <br>
        The ERC-1155 standard provides "semi-fungibility" and is a superset of the ERC-721 standard. Unlike ERC-721,
        where a unique ID represents a single asset, an ERC-1155 token's unique ID represents a class of assets with an
        extra quantity field to indicate how much of each class a wallet owns.

      </p><br><br>



      <h1>
        1.3 BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT NFTs
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        If you are familiar with the concept of creating NFTs, feel free to skip this section. NFT at its core is just a
        variable in a smart contract code. The most common approach is the following: <br>
        1. Upload metadata (image, description, attributes, etc.) to IPFS, which is a JSON-like decentralized database.
        If you've ever used a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase, that's basically it, just decentralized. <br>
        2.
        Based on all the properties you have loaded, a hash is calculated by which you can now access your asset.
        Professionally, it's called a URI, which stands for Unique Resource Identifier. Also, since storing image data
        on the blockchain would be expensive, instead of the image data itself, it stores an image URL in its NFT. The
        image itself can be stored in IPFS. Just not in the JSON you use for NFT creation. <br>
        3.

        A smart contract function responsible for minting is invoked and maps the URI created in the previous step to
        your account address. <br>
        4.
        That is all. Since the code on the blockchain is immutable, and we have a token ID variable that tracks each
        unique NFT creation in a given smart contract, even if the same URI will be used twice, it will still be a
        different NFT. <br> <br>
        In short, minting can be described as a process of a write operation, which has oneThat is all. Since the code
        on the blockchain is immutable, and we have a token ID variable that tracks each unique NFT creation in a given
        smart contract, even if the same URI will be used twice, it will still be a different NFT.
        goal — associate an address of a creator with a tokenId, which points to token metadata URI on IPFS.

      </p><br><br>

      <h1>
        2. NFT MARKETPLACE
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        Amacrux is a peer-to-peer decentralized marketplace that provides practical modules for minting non-fungible
        tokens (NFTs) represented as useful digital assets in the real and virtual world, allowing buyers and sellers to
        interact with collectibles, apply to online stores and participate in crowdfunding rounds.


      </p><br><br>


      <h1>
        2.1 CATEGORIES
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        To list every possible category would take way too long, but we think you get the idea! That said, here are a
        few of the highlights and most popular NFT categories available. <br><br>
      <h3>2.1.1 PFP</h3> <br>

      PFP are generated images of a character, normally in a “headshot” format. Each one is unique in appearance as
      they contain different algorithmically generated traits in clothing, shape, color and more. <br>
      Avatar NFTs and PFPs serve to generate socio-economic value for like minded communities with projects like Bored
      Ape Yacht Club. <br>
      If you’ve spent enough time on Twitter you may have stumbled across users with avatars as their profile
      picture.When a community strongly backs a generative NFT project like BAYC, members often use their avatar as a
      Photo for Profile or PFP on Twitter or other social media platforms. This action is intended to communicate to
      others in the community that you are a proud member of the group and support its plans for the future. <br> <br>
      <h3>2.1.2 Art</h3> <br>
      Provenance, or proof of ownership and origin of art objects, is provided via the blockchain. Copyright
      protection for digital artists is becoming increasingly challenging. Using NFTs, one may purchase a work of art
      and display it in a digital environment while being fully aware of the asset's history, including the artist's
      identity, date of creation, list of previous owners, and asset’s worth throughout its lifespan. Digital artists
      can let their creativity flow and launch many exciting collections through Amacrux. <br><br>
      <h3>2.1.3 3D</h3> <br>
      The 3D NFTs have manifested in digital collectibles like trading cards, gaming items, characters, etc. Some
      retail brands leverage NFTs to increase customers engagement and create potential revenue streams through new
      products offered. <br> <br>
      <h3>2.1.4 Ticketing</h3> <br>
      Counterfeit products and tickets are a major problem in the sports business, which the blockchain can help
      solve. With the aid of tokenized game tickets produced on the blockchain network comes the immutability of
      blockchain bans counterfeit items and tickets. Although game tickets may all seem the same, each one will
      include unique identifiers that link it to the designated owner on the blockchain. <br> <br>
      <h3>2.1.5 Multimedia</h3> <br>
      Musicians may now tokenize and publish their work as non-fungible tokens thanks to the blockchain and technology
      that powers the network. This has broadened the range of possibilities available to artists to monetize and
      profit from their music, as well as other content related to the music and the artist's public image. Music
      clips and files are one of the newer types of NFTs that have been slowly gaining traction. <br> <br>
      <h3> 2.1.6 Gaming</h3> <br>
      The usage of NFTs in blockchain-based gaming allows users to safely exchange in-game items while also ensuring
      legitimacy and validity. NFTs also allow for the open trading of uncommon goods for cash in a safe and secure
      gaming environment. They are a fantastic way to get virtual ownership of rare and unique gaming items while
      generating income by utilizing users’ gaming abilities. NFTs can provide records of ownership for in-game items,
      fuel in-game economies, and bring a host of benefits to the players. This grants versatility that the players
      (or at least their NFT cards) can be bought and sold for real value. Real players, real value – and a link
      between the real world and your gaming experience. This is the appeal of game asset collectibles. <br> <br>
      <h3> 2.1.7 Metaverse</h3> <br>
      The association of real identities with digital avatars presents opportunities to define access to the metaverse
      with NFTs. For example, tickets to access an event can be based on NFTs and will limit access to the most
      exclusive guests. <br> <br>
      <h3> 2.1.8 Sports </h3> <br>
      Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a money-making opportunity for the sports industry and also a great way for
      sports fans to engage with their favorite teams, athletes and historical moments. People have always loved to
      own sports collectibles and NFTs are now offering a new digitized way of doing it. <br> <br>
      <h3> 3. Using Amacrux.</h3> <br>
      Amacrux is an ideal platform for buying, selling, creating and importing NFTs.
      As a potential buyer, you can search NFTs by category to narrow down your search, but you can also filter by
      trending items, hottest auctions and latest clearances. Alternatively, scroll through artists and users to
      refine your search by person if you already have someone or something in mind.
      The buying process is simple, but it can go one of two ways. Either a seller lists their NFT for auction, or
      they add a set price, take it or leave it. Auctions are exciting to be a part of and often lead to the most
      surprising sales, but a set price is ideal for when you want to make a purchase quickly.
      Selling an NFT works much the same, except you are the one who chooses what type of listing you want. If the
      token is a newly created work of your own, you can set a resale commission value, which means that you get money
      from any future sales of the NFT. On the other hand, if you are re-selling somebody else’s work, you may have to
      give part of the profit to them. <br> <br>

      <h3> 3.1 SELL NFTs</h3> <br>
      If you already have NFTs, you can connect to your trusted digital wallet and import your assets by inserting the
      URL or directly selecting the image displayed on the Amacrux interface.
      Or you can make your own NFT on Amacrux, it is incredibly straightforward! Once you upload the image, all the
      instructions are laid out clearly with simple terminology and straightforward advice.
      Whether or not you have coding experience, you can get your creation into the Amacrux platform.
      Once your collection is ready, it appears on your profile. You can then promote and share it using properties
      and tags- the more details you add, the better!
      To mint non-fungible tokens (NFT) the users are required to fill in information fields, following the steps:
      <br> <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1. Upload file: usted debe subir el archivo de su preferencia como una imagen, vídeo o audio con un
          tamaño máximo de 32 MB, considerando cualquiera de estos formatos: JPG, PNG, GIF, WAV, MP3 y MP4. </li> <br>
        <li>Step 2. Mint NFT: every creator will start their NFT journey by deciding which blockchain they should
          adopt. Most NFT activities we observe are built on Ethereum, due to its capability to attract a broad set of
          users and developers. Soon, the Amacrux users can expect to see more blockchains entering the market. In
          this step, you must insert the NFT metadata to proceed with the minting:
        </li> <br>
        <li>Network: the creators must add the blockchain network to use in order to mint the asset (item). Initially,
          the protocol supports Ethereum blockchain.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Name: Creators need to add a name to identify the item to publish.

        </li>
        <li>
          Description: Specifications can be added for items such as size or supply, potential uses, certifications
          and any information that the creator considers relevant.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Properties: Refers to the attributes and qualities to represent the items (E.G Aesthetics, Rareness and
          versatility).

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Royalties: It is up to the owner to attach a % royalty to obtain passive income from secondary sales of
          their works. Royalty percentages range between 0 and 10%.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Number of copies (available for multiple items): This will determine the number of existing NFT copies. It
          is possible to reduce this number by burning the NFT not sold.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Gasless – Users can check this box if they want the future NFT buyer to cover minting gas fees. Once NFTs
          are minted, they will be stored on the blockchain, unchangeable and tamper-proof.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Step 3. List NFT: In this last step, you must set an NFT price and the method of sale. Initially, only two
          of the four methods mentioned in the lightpaper will be available, these are:
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Fixed-price: seller lists the NFT for a price that never changes, unless you decide to remove it from the
          list. The seller can also activate notifications to receive offers lower than the set price.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          English auction: timed, minimum price auction. If the auction ends with a bid of less than 1 ETH, the seller
          can choose the highest bid or cancel the auction. The buyer with the highest bid at any time is considered
          the one with a standing bid, which can only be displaced by a higher bid from the floor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      In addition, it is suggested to fill in the other fields included in this step:
      Unlockable content: include unlockable content that can only be revealed by the owner of the item.
      Paying with cryptocurrency is required for each sale method and the platform takes 1.5% of the final sale in
      each transaction.
      </p><br><br>

      <h1>
        3.2 COLLECTIONS
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        It should be noted that the procedure is very similar to creating an NFT collection, you only need to take into
        account the following aspects: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you mint an item in Amacrux the art is added by default to the ERC-721/BEP-721 or ERC-1155/BEP-1155
          folder (if you include multiple copies). This folder is public for any user and belongs to the Amacrux
          collection.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          When you create your own collection, you are creating a new folder in your name, only you have access to
          edit this folder.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          When creating a new collection you will be asked to fill in some additional fields such as:

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Category: Creators can catalog their digital works as profile pictures (PFP), art, 3D, ticket, multimedia,
          gaming and metaverse.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Tags (optional): Tags can be used to group related terms from items of a collection.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Sensitive content: it is recommended to check the box if the content to be listed includes any of the
          sensitive terms exposed by Amacrux. Sensitive content criteria.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Contacts (optional): You can make yourself known to the Amacrux community by adding your social profiles.

        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Creating a new collection requires signing a transaction on the blockchain so be prepared to cover gas fees.

        </li>
      </ul>
      Overall, having your own collection makes it easier for you to promote your work, as you can share your
      collection rather than individual pieces, making sharing more attractive to collectors.

      <h1>
        3.3 DELAY MINTING
      </h1> <br>

      <p>


        Stop worrying about high Ethereum gas fees! By activating the delay minting function, the NFTs you want to
        create in the Amacrux collection will be minted absolutely free. <br>
        But how does this happen? <br>
        Actually, the NFT minting process is frozen until the moment of purchase. In other words, it is the buyer who
        pays the gas minting. Otherwise, your NFT is kept safely stored in IPFS where you have full control. When
        creating the NFT with the delay minting, you will just need to sign the “minting authorizations” with your
        wallet. It’s free, and it guarantees that you always remain in control over your creations. <br> <br>
        The delay minting functionality is currently available for Amacrux default collection only. There is no charge
        to create an NFT, but it does not become officially minted until somebody buys it.
        If you want to burn the delay minted NFT, you will need to pay the gas fee as with the regular NFTs, according
        to the standard (single or multiple).

        3.4 ROYALTIES
      </h1> <br>

      <p>

        If you’re a creator, using Amacrux means you can set your own royalty percentage up to 10%. Also, becoming a
        creator is as easy as connecting a digital wallet and starting trading your NFTs.

      </p><br><br>
      <h1>
        4. SOCIALFI MODEL
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        Unlike the Web2 social networks, the use of SocialFi on web3 provides higher levels of privacy and security for
        users personal data, allowing creators of content to monetize their transmissions and interactions while
        protecting their personal interest in the virtual space.
      </p><br><br>

      <h1>
        4.1 UGC (user-generated content)
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        The most significant use of NFTs today is in digital content. Content creators see their profits enhanced by
        NFTs, as they power a creator economy where users have the ownership of their content over to the platforms they
        use to publicize it.
        This means that Amacrux can offer new types of interactions, like these (rolling out soon): <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Collections offer: Users can make an offer that covers all NFTs in a selected collection.
        </li>
        <li>Contents offer: Unlike offering collections, users can make a custom offer and request an early trial from
          content creators.
        </li>
        <li>Limit orders: Users can open limit orders in multiple collections.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Within Amacrux, it also made sure to retain compatibility for deploying on ETH scaling solutions such as the
      Polygon layer 2 integration.
      </p><br><br>

      <h1>
        4.2 FREELANCE
      </h1> <br>

      <p>

        As NFTs become even more popular, many are chomping at the bit to create their own NFT collection. However, not
        everyone has the knowledge or the desire to create NFTs from a technical or artistic standpoint.
        Soon, the users of Amacrux can find freelancers to develop NFTs projects, with just selecting the person you
        think is right and showing the main idea of ​​the project along with the budget, without additional charges.
        This is especially useful for those who freelance or those who work in creative fields such as designers and
        writers. The NFTs market has given freelancers and creatives the opportunity to monetise their intellectual
        property without having to give up the rights on their content.
        Any user you’ll want to look for specific features and assurances when hiring someone to help you with your NFT
        needs. With that in mind, the platform will provide the following: <br>

      <ul>
        <li>Simple-to-operate filtering system: with thousands of NFT freelancers to choose from, you’ll need a filter
          to help you find the right one.</li>
        <li>Designer portfolios: these allow freelancers to show you examples of their previous work, allowing you to
          determine if their style is compatible with your NFT concept.
        </li>
        <li>Intellectual property (IP) rights: the sale of NFTs could lead to legal issues. These will either grant
          you full intellectual property rights or give you the option to purchase them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Only previously moderated resumes will be available in this list.

      </p><br><br>

      <h1>
        4.3 CROWDFUNDING
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        Projects involving NFT must have strong NFT communities to succeed. A specific blend of exclusivity and
        community is necessary for NFT initiatives to utilize social media to their fullest potential. Each owner of an
        NFT for a project is automatically a shareholder and a representative. <br>
        Amacrux will provide a decentralized financial services interface such as crowdfunding. This process will help
        independent creators raise funds by pre-selling unique digital assets represented as NFTs. <br>
        In short, the Amacrux marketplace will serve as an incubator for the successful launch of digital assets in
        innovative projects pre-approved by the DAO community of users and members. <br>
        Giving NFT owners full stewardship of their works enables proactive participation in the ecosystem, opening the
        door to deep liquidity from communities interested in exchanging real value.

        4.4 NFT BASED-SUBSCRIPTIONS
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        NFT-based subscriptions are exclusive programs that use NFTs as access keys to unlock a variety of services and
        rewards. According to the needs of the users, Amacrux subscriptions are divided into memberships and
        advertising.

      NFT movement. <br>
      If your lifestyle or needs change, you can easily resell your membership NFT on whatever marketplace you prefer
      — and you might actually make money doing so. <br>
      How do NFT Memberships work? <br>
      An NFT membership uses a process known as token gating to restrict specific types of content, events,
      communities, services, and other benefits to people who own a particular NFT. Token gating is considerably more
      effective than a user account because accounts are easily shared while crypto wallets are unlikely to be shared
      between people. <br>
      Why use NFT-based memberships and not existing forms of verifying access? <br>
      If you know anything about blockchain, you know that it is basically a digital ledger consisting of blocks
      harboring immutable on-chain transactions. Furthermore, Amacrux offers support for the most decentralized and
      secure chains. So, these two factors make NFT-based memberships incredibly safe. <br> In addition, on-chain data
      is publicly available, which ensures transparency. <br> Tools such as MetaMask enable you to store your NFTs
      easily, and since these same tools (hot crypto wallets) are used for Web3 authentication, NFT-gated websites are
      relatively user-friendly. Once users connect wallets to the marketplace, it is easy to check if they own the
      proper NFT.

        4.5 AMACRUX DAO
      </h1> <br>

      <p>
        A DAO is a blockchain-based organization that rewrites the rules on leadership and governance. It uses smart
        contracts to replace hierarchical structures. <br>
        Users vote on a poll by signing a transaction on a Web3 wallet like MetaMask, using AMAX tokens to dictate the
        weight of your vote(s). For example, if one AMAX is equivalent to one voting share, then those who hold more
        voting shares have more influence on the decision.
        There are DAO channels in discord with information about the progress and current actions of the DAO.
        Discussions that lead to actions and discussion on current actions help to shape the direction of the DAO. <br>
        Benefits of a DAO structure
        DAOs remove barriers to the decision-making process, such as who can propose changes to platform governance or
        who has voting power (shareholders and board of directors in traditional companies). Here you can see the main
        benefits of implementing a DAO structure in Amacrux: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The contract defines the rules of the organization and holds the treasure of the group. Once the contract
          is active on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by voting. If someone tries to do something that
          is not covered by the rules and logic of the code, they will not be able to do it. And since the treasury is
          also defined by the smart contract, no one can spend the money without the group's approval.
        </li>
        <li>It is possible to create a risk fund that groups investment capital and vote on the applicable projects to
          opt for crowdfunding. Refunded money could later be redistributed among the members of the DAO.
        </li>
        <li>Donations can be received from any user through the platform, and at the same time, members can decide how
          they want to spend the donations through the Foundation.
        </li>
      </ul>

        5. PAYMENT METHODS AND SERVICE FEES
      </h1> <br>

      <p>

        Amacrux will work with three blockchains: Ethereum and Binance (BSC). The only way to buy, sell, or trade NFTs
        through Amacrux is by connecting a supported Ethereum wallet and crediting it with the cryptocurrency like
        MetaMask. <br> <br>
        For this moment, there is no option for card payments or bank transfers.
        The standard service fee for NFT transactions on Amacrux is 1.5%. This rate applies from side to side (buyer and
        seller).

        6. Architecture
      </h1> <br>

      <p>

        <strong> Outline of the minting process of NTFs in the Amacrux market</strong>
        <br> <br>
        In essence, the Amacrux architecture includes the interaction of the smart contract with the Ethereum/BSC nodes
        through Infura, which contains all the details of the transactions in the market. <br>
        After performing the validations, successful messages or exceptions are sent to the client through a digital
        wallet, in our case MetaMask. <br>
        This wallet needs to be paired with the platform (only the first time) with additional validation (RPC
        Validation) taking place reflected on the front-end via React.js. At the same time, the front-end (React.js)
        must interact with the back-end (Node.js) of the dApp (Amacrux) to propagate the data from the users' wallets,
        so that the frontend can extract recent changes and show them according to the profiles of creators and
        collectors in the Amacrux market. <br>
        The back-end is being developed with Node.js, which manages the creation of an item (NFT), and as a result,
        generates a Hash ID for that item, which is then sent back to the front-end so the transaction can start with
        the smart contract. <br>
        Finally, once the transaction is confirmed, we release the asset onto the IPFS network, ensuring that the future
        owner will always be able to prove that the graphical representation they own is indeed the original. <br>
        User data such as transactions, IP connection and others are stored directly in PostgreSQL (Database).

        6.1 THOUGHTS
      </h1> <br>

      <p>

        Before starting in any NFT market, it is necessary to carry out objective research to identify market
        opportunities that may arise within a community of users interested in acquiring unique digital pieces. <br> In
        addition, the risks associated with investing in this class of assets must be known, such as high volatility,
        collapses and hacks in the native block chain, possible scams and other unpredictable phenomena that imply a
        partial or total loss of funds. <br>
        When visiting Amacrux for the first time, a quick guide is generated to show newcomers the functionalities of
        the platform. <br> Next, they will be asked to connect a web 3.0 provider (e.g, Metamask) to link the crypto
        wallet and start trading NFTs with other users without restrictions. <br> Any user can mint an unlimited number
        of NFTs, considering a permitted format and sufficient funds to pay for the gas that the Ethereum blockchain
        will require.
        Any digital work will be scrutinized through the IPFS, based on access to metadata that contains the NFT
        information necessary to establish proof of ownership. <br> Once the digital property is approved, the creator
        must add a price to the item as well as a method of sale (fixed price or auction); to then be traded on the
        market. <br>
        Why use open source software? <br>
        Open source software is developed in a decentralized and participatory manner, so it relies on peer review and
        community production. In addition, it is usually more economical, flexible and durable than its proprietary
        alternatives, since the community is in charge of actively collaborating with the development of the project.
        <br>
        Here are some reasons why users prefer to interact with open source platforms. <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Code anomalies are identified in a timely manner and in any workflow.
        </li>
        <li>Verifications and improvements of the code are carried out partially, that is, without interruptions in
          the chain.
        </li>
        <li>Active communities are committed to seeking help, resources, and insights that transcend the interest of
          one group or company.
        </li>
        <li>The software construction and development process is transparent, considering that any user can verify the
          status of the project and carry out a deep follow-up without depending on future promises, or worrying about
          possible changes that will be applied to the code.</li>
        <li>Developers and contributors can port the code to any external source of their choice.
        </li>
        <li>The software is released under a specific license making the source code legally available to end users.
          Also, the code itself is free.
        </li>
      </ul>

      As the user and developer community navigate in the market, they will be able to submit their contributions
      through comments, errors reports and requests for updates based on the goals set forth on the project roadmap.
