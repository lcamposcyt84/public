        1. Using Amacrux
      </h2> <br>
      <h4>
        1.1 How do I buy NFTs?
      </h4>
      <p>
        If we know, buying an NFT is much easier than creating one. Only click on the piece you want to own.The
        page will show some details: creator, category, description, properties and others. <br> <br>
        Depending on the status, the NFT can be purchased at a fixed price by selecting the "Buy now" button. On
        the other hand, to bid on a timed auction, click “Place a bid” and follow the instructions to know the
        highest bid, the winner takes the NFT. <br> <br>
        We recommend at all times to do your own #DYOR research as this is an informational article only, please
        do not take this as financial advice. You are responsible for your investment.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.2 How do I sell NFTs?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Unlike other markets, on Amacrux you can sell NFTs without registration, just navigate to the top right
        of the page and click the "Sell" button.
        Select the NFT you would like to sell from your wallet. If you do not have an NFT available to sell,
        please refer to the "How do I create an NFT?" <br> <br>
        Once you import the NFT from your digital wallet and sign the transaction, you'll be taken to the
        listing page, where you can choose the price and method of sale.
        You can choose between fixed price (you set the NFT price) or timed auction (you set a start price and
        reserve with a duration time). <br> <br>
        Lastly, you'll see the service fees from the listed at the bottom. Remember that Amacrux includes a
        service fee of 1.5%, not counting the possible royalties (earnings of the creator). <br> <br>
        If you agree, you'll then be asked to confirm your sale by signing a transaction.
        If you’ve never sold on Amacrux before, you’ll need to initialize your wallet first. In addition, if the
        item you're listing was not minted on Amacrux but through a custom contract, there may be an additional
        approval and signature required to allow Amacrux to trade the item on your behalf.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>1.3 How do English auctions work?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Auctions are an attractive sales method for collectors who wish to participate in bidding.
        At the moment, only the English auction is available where the highest bidder takes the NFT. Here, you
        can set a duration for the auction using the calendar. The default time is UTC.
        Amacrux will automatically complete the transactions as per auctioneer's instructions. The buyer will
        need ETH to create a bid.
        If you're using a Sell to highest bidder auction to sell your item, you can set a reserve price. If you
        don't receive any bids equal to or greater than your reserve price, the auction will end without a sale.
        Once an auction starts, you can't change the reserve or opening price.

      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.4 What crypto wallets can I use with Amacrux?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Initially, you can connect to Amacrux using MetaMask. MetaMask is the most popular Web3 wallet in the
        crypto space. Soon, other wallets like Trust Wallet and Brave Wallet will be enabled.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.5 What currencies can I use on Amacrux?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The core currency on Amacrux is Ethereum (ETH). Other cryptocurrencies such as Binance coin (BNB) and
        Matic (MATIC), as well as our native token AMAX, will be launched next.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.6 Which blockchains does Amacrux support?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Amacrux is a multi-chain platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. Coming soon, EVM compatible chains
        like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon will be integrated.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.7 What is Amacrux and what differentiates it from other NFT markets?
      </h4>
      <p>
        First, Amacrux is not just an NFT marketplace, it is a platform for monetizing user content (UGC) from
        the properties offered by NFTs. For users, this translates into the following benefits:
        <li> Mint NFT for free ✔️ Creators will no longer worry about paying high gas fees thanks to Amacrux's
          feature known as "Delay Minting". If you want, the buyers will pay the minting gas for you.</li>
        <li>The process of minting and trading NFTs is simplified by allowing the implementation of any EVM
          (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain.</li>
        <li>Users can apply your NFT projects for funding by completing the launch or crowdfunding processes.
        </li>
        <li>There is no need to apply KYC to trade digital assets on the market.
          Amacrux currently supports Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). But, in near future other robust
          blockchains such as Polygon and Solana will be integrated.
        </li>
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.8 What is a verified account and how to get it?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A purple checkmark on an user account means that the creator has been verified for authenticity by
        Amacrux. Soon, we will enable the option to verify creators.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        1.9 How to create a collection in Amacrux?
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you don’t have any collections created, then this page will be empty. Each collection is displayed
        here in your account as a way to organize them but also show off the crypto art you’ve either created or
        purchased.
        Ok, lets start !
        Click on "Create a collection" to get started.
        You’ll be taken to a new form page. This is where you’ll input basic information about your collection.
        To begin you are faced with two image upload areas. These are images that will appear in your collection
        and on your collections page. Logo image is the avatar for your collection and banner image is the
        banner behind your profile avatar.
        Scrolling down you’ll see sections titled name, category description, quantity and contacts. In this
        last section, you get some input fields for social media channels. This could come in handy depending on
        how you market your work.
        That’s it. You’ve now created your first NFT collection. No collection is complete without its first
        item in it.
        After you’ve created your collection, assuming you have art ready, minting an item is just as easy as
        creating a new collection. It’s actually even easier. To get started creating an item you can click on
        any of the calls to action titled "Create an NFT".

        2. Importing/Creating NFT.
      </h2> <br>
      <h4>
        2.1 ¿How do I import an NFT on Amacrux?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        If you already own NFT you can connect to your trusted digital wallet (eg MetaMask) and import your assets by
        inserting the URL or directly selecting the image displayed on the Amacrux interface.
        Attention: you can only import one NFT at a time.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        2.2 How do I create an NFT on Amacrux?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Any user with no coding experience can create an NFT on Amacrux in three simple steps:
      <ol> <br>
        <li>Select Sell in the upper right corner of the Amacrux home page. There you will see options to import or
          create an NFT. You must select the "Create an NFT'' button. Next, a tab will appear to upload a file from
          your computer as an image, video or audio with a maximum size of 32 MB. It can be a JPG, PNG, GIF, WAV, MP3
          or MP4. <br> <br>
          Once the file has been successfully uploaded, select the "Upload" button.
        </li> <br>

        <li>
          Set up the details of your NFT (This is known as metadata):
        </li>
        Choose which blockchain you'd like to mint your NFT on.
        Add a name and brief description to your item.
        You can also check the properties box to specify the attributes of the NFT (such as rarity level) and make it
        stand out within a collection.
        Select the royalties you want to receive from every secondary sale (you can only receive a maximum of 10% of
        the total amount each time your NFT is sold).
        If you want, you can include multiple versions of the NFT (ERC-1155) or ignore for it to be unique (ERC-721).
        If you have enabled "multiple versions", then an option will appear to add the number of copies.
        If you enable “gasless”, the buyer of your NFT covers the fees. By default, checking this option adds the item
        to the Amacrux collection.
        Click “Mint” and sign the transactions with your wallet.
        <li>Finally, you must complete the list by filling in the following pieces of information:
        </li>
        You must establish one (1) of the methods of sale: Fixed Price or English Auction (Highest Bid).
        In an English auction, you must add the opening price and the reserve price. In addition, the duration that
        the auction will be active.
        Finally, you can insert tags that describe your NFT as well as your contacts. You can also check the
        “Unlockable content” box if you want the content to be unlocked when purchased by the owner.
        Click “List” and sign the transactions with your wallet.
        You must cover the service fee (1.5%) in order to list the item on the market.
        Basically, creating an NFT requires two actions:
        Minting token;
        Listing token on the market.
        Make sure you have enough ETH coins in your digital wallet to pay the minting fees. Otherwise, if you don't
        have enough ETH or don't want to pay for the minting gas in advance, you can check the “Gasless” box and the
        buyer will take care of paying for the gas for you.
        If you want to launch your own collection, you will have to pay gas fees to mint NFTs.
        There is no need to register on the platform or complete the identity verification (KYC) process to mint NFTs
        on Amacrux.
      </ol> <br>
      </p>

      <h4>
        2.3 On which blockchain are NFTs minted on Amacrux?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Initially, NFTs will be able to be minted on the Ethereum blockchain under the ERC-721 (Single) and ERC-1155
        (Multiple) standards. Soon, it is expected to integrate the networks of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon.
      </p> <br>

      <h4>
        2.4 What are single and multiple standards?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        There are several frameworks for the creation and issuance of NFTs. The most prominent of these is ERC-721, a
        standard for the issuance and trading of non-fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
        A more recent and improved standard is ERC-1155. It allows a single contract to contain both fungible and
        non-fungible tokens, opening up a whole new range of possibilities. Standardizing the issuance of NFTs allows
        for a higher degree of interoperability, which ultimately benefits users.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        2.5 What are the file formats allowed in the market??
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Images: JPG, PNG and GIF.
        Audio: MP3 and WAV.
        Video: MP4.
        Only files with a size less than or equal to 32 MB are accepted.

      </p> <br>
      <h2>
        3. Minting NFT
      </h2> <br>
      <h4>
        3.1 What is gas minting?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Gas minting are transaction fees paid to miners on Ethereum. Amacrux does not receive these fees and is not able
        to refund them. Amacrux can estimate gas prices using the ETH Gas Station API, so users can have a better idea
        of ​​gas fees.
        Token approval is required whenever you interact with a cryptocurrency for the first time. These are one-time
        fees per contract or token.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        3.2 What actions need gas fees in Amacrux?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        If you wish to buy, sell or trade NFTs, it is recommended that you have enough ETH or any cryptocurrency
        available on the market to cover the associated gas fees. You will pay gas fees on Ethereum when: <br> <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Approval fee authorizing transactions between NFT smart contract and your wallet (Import case). </li>
        <li>Buying and listing NFT.</li>
        <li>Listing an auction (Only your first time).</li>
        <li>Remove an NFT listing or bids.</li>
        <li>Transferring an NFT to someone.</li>
      </ol>
      However, these actions don't require gas fees:
      <ol>
        <li>Mark “Gasless” for use of the Delay minting function, available only to create NFTs in Amacrux.
        </li>
        <li>Creating a collection.</li>
        <li>Listing an NFT at a fixed price or English auction.</li>
        <li>Change the price of an NFT you've listed.</li>
      </ol>
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        3.3 What is the “Delay minting” function?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Actually, the NFT minting process is frozen until the moment of purchase. In other words, it is the buyer who
        pays the gas minting. Otherwise, your NFT is kept safely stored in IPFS where you have full control. When
        creating the NFT with the delay minting, you will just need to sign the “minting authorizations” with your
        wallet. It’s free, and it guarantees that you always remain in control over your creations.
        The delay minting functionality is currently available for Amacrux default collection only.
        If you want to burn the delay minted NFT, you will need to pay the gas fee as with the regular NFTs, according
        to the standard (single or multiple).
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        3.4 Is it possible to cancel the process of creating the NFT in full minting?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        If and only if the creator has not confirmed the transaction in MetaMask. Otherwise, the process cannot be
        interceded until the minting of the NFT is successfully completed; even more so if the information has been
        uploaded to the blockchain.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        3.5 Where is the NFT information stored?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Amacrux will store the content of the NFT in an interplanetary file system (IPFS), guaranteeing the
        decentralization of the data. Note that the blockchain does not allow media files, but the associated NFT will
        be recorded on the chain.

      </h2> <br>
      <h4>
        4.1 What are the payment methods in Amacrux?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Being a decentralized platform, payments in the Amacrux market are traded in cryptocurrencies. For this, you
        will need a digital wallet like MetaMask to interact with the platform and start trading NFTs.

      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        4.2 What is the floor price?
      </h4> <br>
      <p> Floor price is the lowest price for the items that have been listed in a collection.</p> <br>
      <h4>4.3 Service and trading fees</h4> <br>
      <p>
        Amacrux collects a basic sales fee of 1.5% on all NFT sales, excluding private sales.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        4.4 What is clearance sales?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        A clearance process should be used if you have an effective method of selling risk inventory: either within your
        existing collections or through item liquidation.
        For Amacrux, the clearance sale process is important for the intrusion of brands in the market, allowing them to
        offer their digital products below their conventional price.

      </p> <br>
      <h2>
        5. Troubleshooting
      </h2> <br>
      <h4>
        5.1 What if my wallet is not connecting?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        In most cases, your wallet extension and computer browser might get a little out of sync. There are a number of
        solutions that could resolve wallet connection troubleshooting like MetaMask: <br>
        <li>Make sure your browser and wallet extension are fully updated.
        </li>
        <li>Clear your cache and restart your browser.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure your wallet is set to Ethereum mainnet.
        </li>
        <li>Try to connect using a desktop computer browser, such as Chrome or Brave.
        </li>
      </p> <br>
      <h4>5.2 How do I find my transaction hash?</h4><br>
      <p>
        Holders of NFTs can verify the authenticity of the item by inserting the contract address in the corresponding
        blockchain explorer. In our case, users will be able to go to the etherscan (Ethereum blockchain explorer) and
        thus observe the NFT transaction hash.
        Transaction hashes are unique IDs recording each transaction on the blockchain; this includes NFT purchases,
        sales, and canceled orders. All gas fees paid will generate a transaction hash.

      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        5.3 What does a typed signature request look like?
      </h4><br>
      <p>
        A signature request means you’re authorizing your wallet to take action, such as connecting to Amacrux’s
        platform, buying or selling an NFT.
        If you don't see the sign button at first, don't be worried. In most cases, you will just need to scroll down in
        the wallet extension window until it appears.
      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        5.4 Will ERC-1155 NFTs appear in my wallet?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        Many NFTs use the ERC-1155 token standard, including those creations through the Amacrux collection.
        To view an address's ERC-1155 token transfers, simply head to its tab in the Address page. Clicking on any
        Transaction Details page that involves ERC-1155 token transfers will show the token IDs & quantities transferred
        and, where relevant, details of a trade.

      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        5.5 Why is the wrong owner listed for my NFT?
      </h4> <br>
      <p>
        When you purchase an NFT on Amacrux, the property may take a while to update.
        This delay is typically due to congestion on the Ethereum blockchain. It is recommended to have a little
        patience since at any time the article will be updated in Amacrux.
        However, if you notice that the transaction has been successful in the blockchain explorer (Etherscan) do not
        hesitate to contact us to solve the congestion problem.

      </p> <br>
      <h4>
        5.6 How do I delete an NFT?
      </h4><br>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, it is impossible to remove an item after it is minted. However, here are some options for
        managing the NFTs you don't want to show on your account (Amacrux will enable this options very soon):
        <li>"Hiding an item", this means that the item will be hidden from other users </li>
        <li>“Burning an item" will remove it from your wallet entirely. Only available for ERC-1155 tokens.</li>
        ⚠️ Burning an NFT is irreversible and burned NFTs can’t be retrieved by anyone.
        You should be certain you no longer want to own this NFT before burning it.
        Again, we suggest that if you are sure to burn an item you can follow the steps below correctly: <br>
        1. Select the upper right corner of the item you want to burn.
        2. Click the "Burn" button.
